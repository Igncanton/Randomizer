# Randomizer
This is a personal project created by myself to test my DOM manipulation knowledge, here I tried to make a random playground where you could change things within the page using their respective buttons, each one is tied to an array of elements which appear randomly using the Math.floor and Math.random properties to access them in a randomized way.</br>
It was a fun game to code and I felt very proud of solving the challenge I created for my own.-
